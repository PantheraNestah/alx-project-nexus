# PROJECT NEXUS - Movie Recommendation Backend

## Core Design and Flowchart Processes

### 1. User Authentication and Management
**Registration**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/auth/register`
- Process: A new user provides credentials (i.e., name, email, password). The backend validates the input, hashes the password, and stores the user in the database.

**Login:**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/auth/login`
- Process: The user submits their credentials. The backend verifies them and, if successful, generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) that is sent back to the client. This token will be used to authenticate subsequent requests.

**User Profile**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/user/profile`
- Process: The authenticated user can view their profile information and saved preferences.

### 2. TMDb API Integration and Data Fetching
This process handles all interactions with the third-party TMDb API. It's crucial to isolate this logic to handle errors and potential API changes gracefully.

**Fetching Trending Movies:**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/movies/trending`
- Process: The backend calls the TMDb API's trending endpoint. The results are then processed and sent to the client. This is a prime candidate for caching.

**Movie Details:**
- Endpoint: `GET /api/movies/{tmdb_movie_id}`
- Process: When a user wants to see more details about a movie, the backend fetches this information from TMDb using the movie's ID. This data is also highly cacheable.

**Movie Recommendations:**
- Endpoint: GET /api/movies/{tmdb_movie_id}/recommendations
- Process: Your backend can leverage TMDb's "recommendations" or "similar movies" endpoint to get a list of related movies.

### 3. User Preferences and Personalized Recommendations
The core of the user-centric design, making the recommendations relevant to each user.

**Saving Preferences:**
- Endpoint: `POST /api/user/preferences`
- Process: Authenticated users can save their favorite genres, actors, or specific movies they liked. This data is stored in our database against their user profile.

**Personalized Recommendations Endpoint:**
- Endpoint: GET /api/user/recommendations
- Process: This is where the magic happens. The backend can use a combination of the user's saved preferences and their viewing history to generate a personalized list of movies. For a start, we can fetch movies from TMDb that match the user's favorite genres.

### 4. Robust Error Handling
- API Call Failures: Implementing try-catch blocks for all calls to the TMDb API.
- Fallback Mechanisms: If a call to TMDb fails, the backend can serve data from the cache or return a user-friendly error message.
- Consistent Error Responses: Using a standard error response format for the API so the frontend can handle errors consistently. For example:
``` 
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Could not fetch trending movies at this time. Please try again later."
} 
```
